    As you may have noticed, I have two primary hobbies: linguistics and travel. To me they go together. I would like to commit to a theme for this site, either travel or language study/presentations. I welcome your suggestions.</p>
    <p>I plan to use the skills that I learn in this course to my advantage as a web publications editor and translator (another common title is Content Specialist). If you have a background in web design and language study, check out the career opportunities. </p>
<p>I am also taking LING 403-Corpus Linguistics. A couple of topics covered are word frequency and keywords, so this should be complimentary to designing efficient databases and search engines, which can in turn help with designing more user-friendly websites for customers.</p>
    <p>Outside of class web design projects, I am working on my personal business page and my brother's Ida-Print 3-d printing services. I recently developed a website for a local Finnish-American historian, who specializes in historic barns and cabins.</p>

<p>Welcome to this linguistics tutorial. On this site, you can learn some basic terms and applications in linguistics that I hope will help you with your langauge skills and possibly get you interested in Linguistics as a field of study and to see how it is applicable in the world. The focus will be primarily on some basic subfields, which are indicated in the buttons above. The buttons are arranged in a ascending order, left to right, starting with an introduction about linguistics and proceeding to learning about the smallest units of sound and how they function in phonetics and phonology, moving to word forms in morphology, then to sentence structure and/or grammar in syntax, and then looking at a couple of important subfields, one-typology-which relies on all of the preceeding topics, and language corpora and technology (also called Corpus Linguistics), which employs computer technology to store and organize language data for a number of purposes.</p>
