<h3>Linguistics: A Short Introduction</h3>



<p>Welcome to this linguistics tutorial. On this site, you can learn some basic terms and applications in linguistics that I hope will help you with your langauge skills and possibly get you interested in Linguistics as a field of study and to see how it is applicable in the world. The focus will be primarily on some basic subfields, which are indicated in the buttons above. The buttons are arranged in a ascending order, left to right, starting with an introduction about linguistics and proceeding to learning about the smallest units of sound and how they function in phonetics and phonology, moving to word forms in morphology, then to sentence structure and/or grammar in syntax, and then looking at a couple of important subfields, one-typology-which relies on all of the preceeding topics, and language corpora and technology (also called Corpus Linguistics), which employs computer technology to store and organize language data for a number of purposes.</p>
