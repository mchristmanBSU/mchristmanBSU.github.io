<h3>1. Language Technology and Corpora: A Short Introduction<br></h3>....Welcome to this linguistics tutorial. On this site, you can learn some basic terms and applications in linguistics that I hope will help you with your langauge skills and possibly get you interested in Linguistics as a field of study and to see how it is applicable in the world.</h5></p>

<p>Three areas of interest to me in Language Technology are: Digital Lexicography (digital dictionaries), language database and search engine development, and keywords and their associated phrases and their place in website commerce (as in search results in search engines and online business).</p>

<p>Language Technology and Corpora/Corpus Linguistics is a field which has really blossomed as computer technology has become more advanced and accessible. We can now gather, process, analyze, and learn from vast amounts of language data very easily and quickly. This screenshot demonstrates this concept. Here I did two searches, one using the term "faculty of philosophy" and the other "department of philosophy". As you can see by the locations of universities, the two terms can determine which results will appear. Website meta data can help Google determine sites it will detect. It is evident from this one example that European universities use the term "faculty" in a similar manner to how American universities use "department." </p> Which phrase a user enters will determine a lot of the results in a search. My primary interest in Language Tech/Corpus linguistics has been in making searches more efficient and linguistically broader or more inclusive. Consider if a European person is considering an American university to study philosophy. The hits using the European term won't do much good, but American universities can improve search results if they include European terms in the meta data in a website's programming. This meta data is used by search engines to produce more efficient results.
