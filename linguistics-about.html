<h3>Linguistics: A Short Introduction</h3>

<br>
<br>

<p>Linguistics is the scientific study of language. Linguists look for patterns in language. Some linguists are fluent in other languages, but this is not necessary, although it can be helpful, especially for those linguists studying a particular language or language family. You may think it's just a look at grammar, and learning grammar through rote repetition, or being a grammar nazi or grammar police and enforcing particular rules about how one is supposed to use language. However, Lingusitics is a different way of looking at language in all aspects. It's more about observing and documenting language, promoting language and language change and variation, and improving the learning of other languages. I hope to help you put aside any pre-conceived ideas and give it a try and appreciate how linguistics permeates our closely connected society. </p>


<p>Linguistics has many subfields, a few of which I've included on this page (phonetics and phonlogy, morphology, syntax, typology, and corpus linguistics/language technology).</p>
